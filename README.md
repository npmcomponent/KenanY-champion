*This repository is a mirror of the [component](http://component.io) module [kenany/champion](http://github.com/kenany/champion). It has been modified to work with NPM+Browserify. You can install it using the command `npm install npmcomponent/kenany-champion`. Please do not open issues or send pull requests against this repo.

[![Testling Badge](https://ci.testling.com/KenanY/champion.png)](https://ci.testling.com/KenanY/champion)

## Example

``` javascript
var champion = require('champion');

champion(117);
// => {
// =>   "version": "3.10.3",
// =>   "id": "Lulu",
// =>   "key": "117",
// =>   "name": "Lulu",
// =>   "title": "the Fae Sorceress",
// =>   /* etc, etc. */
// => }
```

You would probably use this with
[node-resteemo](https://github.com/KenanY/node-resteemo):

``` javascript
var resteemo = require('resteemo')('string with contact info');

resteemo.player.ingame('na', 'king trick', function(error, response) {
  if (error) throw error;

  var championID = response.data.game.playerChampionSelections.array[0].championId;

  champion(championID);
  // Now you know the champion that 'king trick' is playing.
});
```

## Installation

``` bash
$ npm install champion
```

[Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) for the browser or use
[Component](https://github.com/component/component):

``` bash
$ component install KenanY/champion
```

## API

``` javascript
var champion = require('champion');
```

### champion(key)

Look up a champion using a _Number_ `key` and return an _Object_ containing
metadata on the champion. If `key` does not match that of any champion, `null`
is returned.

## The array

Yeah, it's huge, but the current method is better than using `fs` or `http`.

If a new champion hasn't been added to the array yet, feel free to open a pull
request. In the future, I might move the array to its own module so that others
can use it in their modules.

## Lessons learned

Originally, this module used `fs.createReadStream` in order to load a JSON file
of champions. This `ReadStream` was then piped to
[JSONStream](https://github.com/dominictarr/JSONStream), but this caused
problems because of a
[known issue](https://github.com/creationix/jsonparse/issues/2) involving
precise numbers (which are used for a champion's health regeneration and such).

Using `fs` also prevented this module from working in the browser. So, I did a
quick refactor and replaced the JSON file with a JavaScript one. This JavaScript
file exports the array of champions and as such can be `require()`d and
browserified.
